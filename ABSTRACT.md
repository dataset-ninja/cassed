The **CaSSeD: Real World Data** dataset is a part of the **CaSSeD: CAVS Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Off-Road Autonomous Driving** comprised of two sets of segmentation data specially targeted for the unstructured, off-road driving environment. The presented one is a real-world semantic segmentation dataset with 1700 images collected at the CAVS proving grounds, a 55-acre area with trails, hills, obstacles, and dense vegetation, similar to a forest environment. Data were collected during winter 2018 and summer 2019 using a Sekonix SF3325-100 GMSL camera mounted on the top of a Polaris Ranger crew XP100, capturing imagery at 10 frames per second. The images are semantically labeled using classes such as *smooth trail*, *rough trail*, *small vegetation*, *forest*, *sky*, and *obstacles*.
