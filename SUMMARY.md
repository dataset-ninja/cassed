**CaSSeD: CAVS Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Off-Road Autonomous Driving (Real World Data)** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 2029 images with 9326 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *forest*, *small vegetation*, *smooth trail*, and other: *rough trail*, *sky*, and *obstacles*.

Images in the CaSSeD: Real World Data dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 8 splits in the dataset: *dataset1C_main_trail* (350 images), *train* (350 images), *dataset3_north_farm* (300 images), *dataset4_north_slope* (300 images), *dataset2_fogdata* (279 images), *dataset1A_brown_field* (200 images), *test* (150 images), and *dataset1B_powerline* (100 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 *test* image set locations: ***browns_field*** (60 images), ***main_trail*** (60 images), and ***powerline*** (30 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Dynetics Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA</span>.
